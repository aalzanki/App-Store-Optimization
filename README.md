#App Store Optimization

Understanding how the App Store works will help you gain more downloads without spending a dime on ads.

##Keywords, keywords, keywords...
Here are the main things you should know about keywords:

#####Comma Separated
Poor: `money tip calculator measure`

Good: `money,tip,calculator,measure`

#####Absolutely No Spaces
Poor: `money, tip, calculator, measure`

Good: `money,tip,calculator,measure`

#####One Word at a Time
Poor: `money, tip calculator, measure`

Good: `money,tip,calculator,measure`

#####Stick to Only Singular Forms
Apple magically adds the plural form if you just include the singular form)

Poor: `tip,tips,calculators,measures`

Good: `tip,calculator,measure`

#####Do Not Use Generic Words
Poor: `good,free,app,game`

Good: `tip,money,calculator,pay,bill`

#####Do Not Type Numbers as Words
Apple magically searches for the worded version of a number)

Poor: `one,two,five,ten`

Good: `1,2,5,10`

#####ALWAYS Fill Up the Keywords Field on iTunes Connect
There's no point of leaving empty spaces. Always fill up all the allowed 100 characters.

#####In-App Purchase Titles Count
In-App Purchase titles are automatically included as keywords. Make sure you take advantage of that.

#####Never repeat any words from the title of the app in the keywords
Words in the title have a higher priority than keywords. Never repeat anything from the title in the keywords. Not even a single word.
#####Research Your Keywords
Make sure you search for your keywords on the App Store to see if you have a chance of getting your app on top of the list. Use services like App Annie, SensorTower and whatever other resource you can use to find keywords that people search for a lot and are easy to get on the top of the list of.


##App's Title
We only have two tips for the app title that are very important:

+ **App's Title on iTunes Connect**
	+ Poor: `iTip Waiters`
	+ Good: `iTip Waiters - Helps You Calcuate Fair Tips`
+ **If I know the name of your app, I should be able to find it Easily**
	+ Poor: `Tips App - Calculator`
	+ Good: `Tipping Wizard - Easily Calculate Tips`
	

## There's More To It
For your app to do well, you have to have a great app, with great design, functionality, icon, screenshots and reviews. However, this tips are a push to increase the amount of downloads you are already getting with a minimal amount of work.
